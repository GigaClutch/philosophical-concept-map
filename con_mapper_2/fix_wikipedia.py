    Justice is the concept of fairness. Social justice is concerned with the fair 
    distribution of resources and opportunities. In Western philosophical tradition, 
    justice has been considered a virtue, a moral quality of being fair and reasonable.

    Justice in its broadest sense is the principle that people receive that which they deserve, 
    with interpretations as to what then constitutes "deserving" being subject to various theories 
    of distributive justice. Distributive justice concerns the socially just allocation of resources.

    In social psychology, justice is a concept originating from various philosophical schools 
    related to equality, liberty, and fairness. Justice is often thought of as the first virtue 
    of social institutions.

    Historically, philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas discussed justice in 
    terms of individual virtue. Modern conceptions expand on this to include social justice and 
    procedural justice.
